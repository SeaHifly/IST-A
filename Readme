An infrared small target dataset and we name it IST-A.
The data are uploading and not finished.

The dataset information will be supplemented in near feature.

If you have finised your paper manucript and want to adopt the datasets, please contact us. We'll try to upload a version to the arxiv as quickly as possible.
(We send our own paper to TGRS but the manucript has been accepted)
