An infrared small target dataset and we name it IST-A.

All images and labels of IST-A have been uploaded. Anyone who needs can take it for research.
After getting some suggestions, we decide not to upload any manuscript to the open platform. If you have to cite the dataset, you may just need to cite the website (https://github.com/SeaHifly/IST-A).

If our manuscript is accepted by any journal, we'll update the information as quickly as possible.

Basic Information of IST-A.

Birds, UAVs, helicopters, planes, and aircraft which can fly at a relatively far distance would be taken as infrared small targets in IST-A. There are 59553 images in training subset while thare are 14756 images in testing subset.There are some images without any target because the targets may be occluded by some other objects like buildings or vegetation. In IST-A, over 87% of targets are smaller than 6Ã—6. Although we focus on targets in the sky, it should be emphasized that the ground is also a major part of the background in IST-A. Vegetation, buildings, and some other objects on the ground are all involved in IST-A.
