An infrared small target dataset and we name it IST-A.

All images and labels of IST-A have been uploaded. Anyone who needs can take it for research.
After getting some suggestions, we decide not to upload any manuscript to the open platform. If you have to cite the dataset, you may just need to cite the website (https://github.com/SeaHifly/IST-A).

If our manuscript is accepted by any journal, we'll update the information as quickly as possible.

Though we don't upload any open versions, we still excerpt the introduction of IST-A in our manuscript and present it below.
