An infrared small target dataset and we name it IST-A.
The data are uploading and not finished. (The author has to do something else for few days. The left part of the training subset will be uploaded before 2023/1/6)

The dataset information will be supplemented in near feature.

If you have finised your paper manucript and want to adopt the datasets, please contact us. We'll try to upload a version to the arxiv as quickly as possible so that you can cite it.
(We send our own paper to TGRS but the manucript has not been accepted)
